Figma Advanced 1-1: Design System
What Is a Design System?
A design system is a collection of reusable elements, defined by style guides and principles, which serve as a template for your design projects.
Benefits of a Design System:
    • Consistency across designs
    • Easier collaboration between team members
    • More efficient workflow and faster design iterations

Color Palette & Style Guides
When creating a design system, start with defining your color scheme and visual effects.
Color Palette Includes:
    • Primary Colors – Main theme colors used across the UI
    • Secondary Colors – Accent colors to highlight or support the primary palette
    • Neutral Colors – For backgrounds, borders, and text
Visual Effects:
    • Add depth using effects like:
        ? Shadows
        ? Blurs

Typography in the Design System
Establish a clear typographic hierarchy for better readability and structure.
Text Hierarchy Examples:
    • Headings (e.g., H1, H2)
    • Body Text
    • Button Text
Use text styles to:
    • Maintain consistency
    • Allow for easy global updates when changing fonts or sizes

Components
What Are Components?
Components are reusable design elements such as:
    • Buttons
    • Input fields
    • Cards
Benefits of Components:
    • Design more efficiently by reusing instead of recreating
    • Update all instances by modifying the main component

Organization Best Practices
Naming & Layer Management:
    • Use meaningful names for layers in the Layers Panel
(e.g., btn/primary, card/product)
    • This improves navigation and collaboration
Component & Style Organization:
    • Store and group components in logical folders
    • Keep styles (colors, text, effects) in shared libraries for easy access and reuse
