Exploring Variants in Figma

In this session, we'll explore Variants in Figma. Variants make it easier to manage different versions of a design element—such as buttons in various states (normal, hover, pressed), or different sizes and colors of components.

By the end of this lesson, you will know how to:

- Create and organize variants in Figma.
- Use variants to manage multiple states of a component.
- Define and adjust properties for variants.
- Use variants effectively to simplify the design process.

1. What are Variants in Figma?

Variants in Figma are a powerful feature that allows you to group multiple versions of a component into a single component set. This means you can have multiple states (e.g., Normal, Hover, Pressed) or versions (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) of a design element in one component and quickly switch between them.

Key Concepts:

- Component Sets: When you create variants, they are organized into a single component set. Each variant can have its own properties (e.g., text, color, size).
- Properties (Props): Each variant can be assigned custom properties such as "State" (e.g., Normal, Hover, Pressed) or "Size" (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- Efficiency: Variants help keep your designs organized and provide fast access to different versions of a component without needing separate components.

2. How to Create and Use Variants in Figma

Step-by-step guide:

Creating a Component Set with Variants:

- Create the base component you want to have multiple versions of (e.g., a button).
- Select the components you want to combine.
- Right-click and select “Combine as Variants.”
- Figma will group them into a single component set as variants.

Adding Properties (Props):

- Once variants are created, you can define properties to describe their differences (e.g., “State” for Normal, Hover, Pressed).
- In the properties panel, define values for each variant’s property—like text, color, or size.

Using Variants in Your Design:

- Drag the component set into your canvas.
- After placing a component, you can choose the desired variant via the properties panel. This allows you to switch states or versions instantly.

3. How to Define Properties for Variants

Properties (props) let you define and control the attributes of each variant. For example, a button might use a property to define its state or size.

Common Properties:

- State: Defines interaction states like “Normal,” “Hover,” or “Pressed.”
- Size: Defines the size of the component (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).
- Color: Defines color schemes (e.g., Primary, Secondary).
- Icon: Indicates if an icon is shown within the component.

How to Use Properties:

- Select a component variant.
- In the properties panel, update values as needed—for example, change “State” from Normal to Hover, or “Size” from Medium to Large.
- All instances of that variant in the design will reflect the change.

4. Examples of Using Variants

Button with Multiple States:

- Create a button component.
- Add variants for Normal, Hover, and Pressed.
- When using the button in your design, switch states using the “State” property.

Icons in Different Sizes:

- Create an icon component.
- Add variants for Small, Medium, and Large.
- Use size property in your designs to switch between them.

Component with Multiple Colors:

- Create a component such as a card or button.
- Add variants with different color schemes like Primary, Secondary.
- Use the color property to easily switch styling in your design.

5. Hands-On Practice: Create and Use Variants

Instructions:

- Open a new Figma file.
- Create a component (e.g., a button) and make at least three variants (e.g., Normal, Hover, Pressed).
- Define properties for these variants—such as text, color, and size.
- Use the variants in your design and adjust properties as needed.
- Share your work with classmates for feedback.
