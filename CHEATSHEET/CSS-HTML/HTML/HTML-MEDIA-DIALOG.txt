1. Media

1.1. Video

The <video> tag allows you to add video to your website.

Example:

<video width="600" controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

This embeds a video with playback controls. The video can be played directly in the browser.

---

1.2. Audio

The <audio> tag is used to add audio files to your website.
Audio files can be played using controls like play, pause, and volume.

Example:

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>

1.3. iFrame

The <iframe> tag lets you embed another webpage or external content into your own website.
Common use cases include embedding YouTube videos, Google Maps, or other third-party resources.

Example:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
        width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

This embeds a YouTube video onto your page.

2. Dialog

The <dialog> tag is used to create a dialog box (like a popup).
Dialogs can be used to display information, ask for confirmation, or get user input.
It can be opened and closed with JavaScript (though understanding JavaScript is not necessary here).

Example:

<dialog id="myDialog">
  <p>Are you sure you want to continue?</p>
  <button onclick="document.getElementById('myDialog').close()">Close</button>
</dialog>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('myDialog').showModal()">Open Dialog</button>

In this example, the dialog will appear when the user clicks the "Open Dialog" button.
The dialog can be closed by clicking the "Close" button.
