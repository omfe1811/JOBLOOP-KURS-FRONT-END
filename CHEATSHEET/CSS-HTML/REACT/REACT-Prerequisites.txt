React: Prerequisites
Running JavaScript Locally
JavaScript is primarily executed in the browser via a JavaScript engine. To run JavaScript locally, we need to install one of these engines. The most popular one is V8, and we can install it through NodeJS.

Additionally, by running JavaScript locally, you now have access to a registry of open-source packages released under free software licenses: the NPM Registry. This makes it easy to bring in third-party functionality into your projects, so you don't have to develop everything yourself.

Useful NPM Commands:
Print short usage information (this applies to almost all CLI programs):

npm --help

node --help

Create a new NPM project in the directory you're in:

npm init

Install a package from the NPM Registry into your project:

npm install name-of-package

Example: npm install react

Uninstall a package from your project:

npm uninstall name-of-package

Example: npm uninstall react

Run a JavaScript file locally:

node path-of-file

Example: node /c/dev/main.js
