1. Margin

   Margin: This is the space outside the element.

   div { margin: 20px; }

   Margins can be used to control the space between elements on the webpage. This space is outside the element's border.

2. Padding

   Padding: Padding is used to adjust the space between the content and the border of an element.

   div { padding: 20px; }

   Padding is used to give the content more space inside the element's border.

3. Border

   Border: A border can be added around an element to define it visually.

   div { border: 2px solid black; }

   Borders can be useful for visually separating elements on the page. They can have different thicknesses, styles, and colors.

4. CSS Reset and Box-Sizing: border-box;

   CSS Reset:
   Used to reset the browser's default styles, so you start with a clean slate for all elements. An example could be:

   * { margin: 0; 
     padding: 0; 
     box-sizing: border-box; 
   }

   Box-Sizing: When using box-sizing: border-box;, padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height. This makes it easier to control the element's size.

5. IDs and Classes: What they are and how to style them

   5.1 IDs: A unique identifier for an HTML element, used to style or select the element on a webpage.

   <div id="header">Welcome to my website!</div>

   #header { font-size: 24px; color: blue; }

   5.2 Classes: Used to style multiple elements at once. You can use the same class on multiple elements in HTML.

   <div class="box">Content 1</div>
   <div class="box">Content 2</div>

   .box { padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black; }

6. Cascade and Specificity

   Cascade: When multiple style rules apply to an element, the cascade principle determines which rule has the highest priority.

   Specificity: Specificity determines which style rule applies when multiple rules conflict. For example, an inline style has higher specificity than a class.
