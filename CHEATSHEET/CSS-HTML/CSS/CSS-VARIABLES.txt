1. What are CSS Variables?

CSS variables allow us to store values that can be reused throughout the CSS.

They are defined using `--` (two dashes before the variable name) and are used with the `var()` function.

Example:

:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
}

body {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}

2. Advantages of CSS Variables

- Reusability: Makes it easier to use the same value in multiple places in your CSS.
- Easy updates: Changing one variable updates all usages of that value.
- Dynamic: Variables can be changed with JavaScript.

3. Best Practices for CSS Variables

- Define variables inside `:root` for global access.
- Use descriptive names for variables.

Example:

:root {
  --font-size: 16px;
  --line-height: 1.5;
  --spacing-unit: 20px;
}
