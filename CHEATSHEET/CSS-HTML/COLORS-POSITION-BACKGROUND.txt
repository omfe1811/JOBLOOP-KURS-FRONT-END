1. Color Formats

1.1 Hex Values

Hex values are used to represent colors in CSS using a six-digit code system. The format is #RRGGBB, where:

    RR represents the intensity of red.
    GG represents the intensity of green.
    BB represents the intensity of blue.

Each pair (RR, GG, BB) consists of two hexadecimal characters (0-9 and A-F). Hexadecimal numbers use a base of 16, where:

    0 is the lowest value (no intensity).
    F is the highest value (maximum intensity).

How to read hex values?

    #000000: This is black because all components (red, green, and blue) have zero intensity.
    #FFFFFF: This is white because all components have maximum intensity.
    #FF0000: This is pure red because red is max (FF), while green and blue are zero (00).
    #00FF00: This is pure green.
    #0000FF: This is pure blue.
    #FF5733: This is a light red-orange color. Let's break it down:
        FF: Maximum intensity for red.
        57: Moderate intensity for green.
        33: Low intensity for blue.

Example in CSS:

background-color: #ff5733; /* Background color set to light red-orange */

Shortened format:

When a hex value has equal pairs for each component (e.g., #FFAA99), you can write it in a shorter form as #FA9. This means:

    F = FF (maximum intensity for red).
    A = AA (mid intensity for green).
    9 = 99 (low intensity for blue).

1.2 RGB

RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. The colors are specified with values ranging from 0 to 255. The format is rgb(red, green, blue). Example:

background-color: rgb(255, 87, 51); /* Light red-orange */

1.3 RGBA

RGBA is an extension of RGB where A stands for alpha (transparency), and the value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Example:

background-color: rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5); /* Light red-orange with 50% transparency */

1.4 HSL

HSL stands for Hue (Tone), Saturation, and Lightness. It provides an intuitive way to describe colors with the format:
hsl(hue, saturation%, lightness%)
Hue (Tone)

    Measured in degrees (0-360) on a color wheel.
    0°: Red, 120°: Green, 240°: Blue, with transitional colors like orange and purple in between.

Saturation

    Specified as a percentage (%).
    0%: Grays (no color).
    100%: Full intensity (pure color).

Lightness

    Specified as a percentage (%).
    0%: Black, 100%: White, 50%: Pure color.

Examples:

background-color: hsl(10, 100%, 50
