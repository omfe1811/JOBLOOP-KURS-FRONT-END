        Thank you for submitting a bug report üíô
        If you need help about your project and it's **NOT** a flyonui bug, please [ask your question in discussion forum](https://github.com/themeselection/flyonui/discussions/new?category=q-a).

        üëâ Before you submit a new bug, please do the following steps:

        1. Update your FlyonUI (and other dependencies) to the latest version (`npm i -D flyonui@latest`)
        3. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/themeselection/flyonui/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [discussion forum](https://github.com/themeselection/flyonui/discussions?discussions_q=). You may find a solution there
        4. Open one issue per problem. Don't list multiple issues in the same page because that would be hard to track.
