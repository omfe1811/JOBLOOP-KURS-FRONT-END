Weâ€™ve learned about asynchronous JavaScript, particularly how to use Promises and async/await to handle asynchronous code. In this task, youâ€™ll practice those skills by creating a website that uses an API to fetch data.

Youâ€™re free to choose any free API (hereâ€™s a comprehensive list).

Project Requirements
To ensure you're challenging yourself, your project must include a certain level of complexity, such as:

An API with multiple endpoints that you use in your project.

An API with an endpoint that accepts parameters in the URL.

API data that must be looped through to fetch or generate content.

Your project must meet at least two of these criteria.

Tips for Implementation
The documentation of most public APIs provides details on how to use them, what endpoints they have, and which parameters they accept. Read the documentation carefully! ðŸ¤“

Do not use APIs that require an API key (we havenâ€™t covered how to secure API keys yet).

Recommendations
This is a perfect opportunity to build something that stands out in your portfolio! I strongly recommend focusing on design to make your project look great.

Previous students at Kodehode have successfully used APIs like this to create exciting projects.

Good luck, and remember to challenge yourself by exploring APIs with a bit of complexity! ðŸŒŸ
