ðŸ§  Functions and Methods Exercise
Read the task description CAREFULLY.
Show examples in your code that test your functions and methods.
Use a mix of arrow functions and functions declared with the function keyword.
Add comments in your code briefly explaining what it does.

âœ… Task 1
Create the following function:
The function should take a number as a parameter and return:
"Odd number" if the number is odd
"Even number" if the number is even
(Use return, don't use console.log inside the function)

ðŸ§ª Test the function with different numbers

âœ… Task 2
Create the following function:
The function should take a string as a parameter and return the string in ALL CAPS, with an exclamation mark at the end.

Example:
"This is cool" should return "THIS IS COOL!"

âœ… Task 3
Create the following function:
The function should take two parameters:

A name (string)

An hour (number)

The function should return:

"Invalid time" if the hour is less than 0

"Good night (name)" if hour is between 0â€“5

"Good morning (name)" if hour is between 6â€“11

"Good day (name)" if hour is between 12â€“17

"Good evening (name)" if hour is between 18â€“23

"Invalid time" if hour is greater than 23

If no hour is received, return an error message

âœ… Task 4
Create the following function:
The function should take an array as a parameter and return a new array with the first and last elements removed.

Example 1:
["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"] should return ["Green", "Blue"]

Example 2:
["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six"] should return ["Two", "Three", "Four", "Five"]

âœ… Task 5
Create the following function:
The function should take a string as a parameter.

Use string methods to:

Replace the word "difficult" with "fun"

Trim spaces from the beginning and end

Then return the updated string.

Example 1:
" Javascript is difficult " â†’ "Javascript is fun"

Example 2:
" It is difficult to use methods " â†’ "It is fun to use methods"

Example 3:
" difficult " â†’ "fun"

âœ… Task 6
Complete the following steps to manipulate the items array using the appropriate array methods:
js
Copy
Edit
const items = ["Book", "Pen", "Notebook", "Eraser", "Pencil", "Marker"];
Step-by-step:
Remove the first element ("Book") from the array.

Find and replace "Eraser" with "Ruler".

Use splice() to remove "Pen" and "Notebook", and insert "Highlighter" in their place.

Combine all items into a single string separated by " | ".

Extra Challenge: Create a new array that only includes items that contain the letter "e".

ðŸŒŸ Extra Challenge #1 (Optional)
Create the following function:
The function should take two parameters: an array and a string.

If the array contains the string, remove it and return the updated array.

If the array does NOT contain the string, add it to the end and return the array.

Example 1:
(["Red", "Green"], "Blue") â†’ ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

Example 2:
(["Red", "Green", "Blue"], "Green") â†’ ["Red", "Blue"]

Example 3:
(["One", "Two", "Three"], "Four") â†’ ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four"]

Example 4:
(["One", "Two", "Three"], "Two") â†’ ["One", "Three"]

ðŸŒŸ Extra Challenge #2 (Optional)
Create the following function:
The function should take one parameter.

Behavior:
If the parameter is a string: return the string with "ðŸ˜Ž" added at the start and end

If itâ€™s a number:

Double the number

Convert to string

Return with "ðŸ˜Ž" at the start and end

If itâ€™s a boolean:

If true, return "ðŸ˜ŽYesðŸ˜Ž"

If false, return "ðŸ˜ŽRelaxðŸ˜Ž"

If itâ€™s any other datatype:

Return "ðŸ˜ŽOnly primitive valuesðŸ˜Ž"
