Creating a Movable Element

Hello, JavaScript enthusiasts!

In this task, weâ€™ll explore the practical side of JavaScript by creating a movable HTML element. The goal is to make the element move freely around the browser window. The specifications are as follows:

Functionality:

Arrow Key Navigation: Implement functionality to move the element in four directions â€“ up, down, left, and right â€“ using the arrow keys.

Click to Position: Allow the user to move the element directly by clicking anywhere on the page.

Stay Visible: Make sure the element remains within the visible area of the screen.

Implementation Tips:

Use addEventListener() to capture events from arrow keys and mouse clicks.

Use position: absolute to give the element full freedom of movement.

Optional Challenges:

You can improve the implementation with the following additions:

Implement collision detection or add obstacles for extra complexity.

Styling:

While the main focus is functionality, feel free to style the element however you like. This task is great for a portfolio, so take the time to make the page presentable.

Summary:

Set up event listeners that capture arrow key presses and mouse clicks.

Implement logic to update the elementâ€™s position based on the detected events.

Optionally add extra features or constraints to make the task more challenging.

Remember, the goal of this exercise is to strengthen your understanding of event listeners and manipulation of HTML elements using JavaScript.

Clean and well-organized code makes it easier to keep track of all components! If you need to use a loop, take the opportunity to practice the advanced array methods we've gone over.

Also, donâ€™t forget to activate GitHub Pages for your submission.

Good luck with your coding adventure! ðŸŽ‰
