🎯 Objective
The goal of this assignment is to help you practice using CSS animations, transitions, and transforms to create interactive and visually appealing elements on a webpage.
You will apply your creativity and the CSS techniques you’ve learned to design an engaging layout or interactive component.

📋 Assignment Requirements
🧱 Page Layout and Structure:
Create a simple webpage with at least 3 different sections (e.g., header, main content, footer).

Include at least:

One button

One link

One image

🎞️ Animation:
Use CSS @keyframes to animate at least one element on the page.

The animation must include two or three steps (use percentage values like 0%, 50%, 100%).

Example animations:
A bouncing ball

A text that fades in and moves

A button that changes color and scales on hover

🔁 Transition:
Add smooth transitions to elements like buttons, links, or images.

Use transition to create effects on hover or focus (e.g., change background color, size).

Example transitions:
Change the color of a button on hover

Scale an image smoothly on hover

A text block that changes opacity on hover

🔄 Transform:
Use CSS transform on at least one element.

Apply transformations like rotate, scale, translate, or skew to move or resize the element or change its orientation.

Example transforms:
Rotate an element when the page loads

Make an image zoom in on hover

Skew a heading to give a 3D effect

💡 Combine Animation, Transition, and Transform:
Try combining all three—animation, transition, and transform—on a single element.

Example:
A button that scales up and changes color on hover,

The text inside the button also fades in using @keyframes.

⭐ Bonus Challenge (Optional):
Create an interactive menu or card design that uses a combination of animations, transitions, and transforms.
When the user hovers over the menu or card, apply multiple effects such as:

Scaling

Rotation

Color change

Position shift
