ðŸŽ¨ Introduction
In this assignment, you will learn how to use pseudo-elements and pseudo-selectors to apply advanced styling to your HTML content.
Youâ€™ll use both ::before and ::after, as well as selectors like :nth-child, :hover, :first-child, and more.

ðŸ“‹ Assignment Specifications
Create a webpage with the following content:

                    A main heading (<h1>) that describes the topic (e.g., "Learn Pseudo-elements").         

                    An unordered list (<ul>) with at least 5 items.

A section element (<section>) containing three subsections (<div>).

A button with an interactive action.

ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Pseudo-elements (::before and ::after)
Task 1.1
Add a decorative line before the heading using ::before.

Task 1.2
Add a star after each list item using ::after.

Task 1.3
Give the ::before and ::after elements different colors and sizes.

ðŸ”¸ Part 2: Pseudo-selectors
Task 2.1
Change the background color of all odd-numbered list items using :nth-child(odd).

Task 2.2
Add a transition effect on the button when the user hovers over it (use :hover).

Task 2.3
Give the first and last items in the list a different text color using :first-child and :last-child.

Task 2.4
Use :not() to exclude one element from styling.

ðŸŒŸ Extra Challenge (Optional)
Create a highlighted section with:

A decorative ::before and ::after that create a "box" around the text.

Use :focus to apply a special effect to a text field when itâ€™s focused.

Use :nth-of-type to style one specific subsection.

âœ… Submission Requirements
Use separate HTML and CSS files.

Save your project in a folder called pseudo-task.
